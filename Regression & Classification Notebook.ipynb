    "**Artificial Intelligence (AI):** Artifical intelligence can be disaggregated into two (2) separate categories or ideas:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) **Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)** - AGI refers to machines that mimic all the tasks that humans can do and perhaps perform the tasks even better.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) **Artificial Narrow Intelligence (ANI)** - ANI refers to machines that handle a single task. Examples of these include a smart speaker, a self-driving car, a recommender system or a system that identifies product defects in a production line.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Most of the progress these days have been in ANIs and not necessarily in AGIs, so you can rest easy knowing that there will be no robot invasions coming any time soon.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Machine Learning** is a tool that is used in AI that gives the computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed to do so. It can be classified under three (3) categories or procedures:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) **Supervised Learning** - In supervised learning, we are aware of the values or labels of the outputs for given inputs from the previous data that we have. The machine learns the input to output mappings based on these past records to predict future outputs of new data. One use case example is an email spam filter which detects, given an input of emails, what is spam and what is not spam. Previous data would be already classified emails as spam or not spam. Examples of supervised learning procedures include linear regression, multiple regression and logistic regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) **Unsupervised Learning** - In unsupervised learning, we are not aware of the values or labels of the outputs for given inputs from the previous data that we have. We use the data to infer clusters or groups of the data-points by similar properties that are shared in the dataset and in some cases detect anomalies. Examples of unsupervised learning procedures include K-means clustering, hierarchical clustering, db scan clustering and anomaly detection.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) **Reinforcement Learning** - reinforcement learning is semi-supervised learning in that some part of the data is labelled, and some part is not labelled for future actions. The model learns slowly by seeing past data and will learn and then apply its knowledge to the new data as it comes up. These procedures are applied to systems that perform games like chess and backgammon, and even in robotics. The machine will know what to do next but there is uncertainty about the future until the previous task is performed.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Supervised learning procedures are the most commonly used ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Quick Quiz 1:**\n",
    "*Another example of a supervised learning procedure is pricing or valuing houses based on their aesthetics. What would you consider as the inputs and outputs in this scenario? You can give some examples for inputs.*\n",

    "*What is a use case example of an unsupervised learning procedure?*\n",
    "\n",

    "<br>\n",
    "The input data can be structured, unstructured or semi-structured. Structured data can be seen as data that is organised in tables. For example, data that you would see in relational databases. Unstructured data would be data that is not organised in tables. Examples include images, audio records, video records and text records. There is also semi-structured data which comprises of some elements of structured data and some elements of unstructured data.\n",

    "**Data Science** - According to Wikipedia, “data science is an inter-disciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms and systems to extract knowledge and insights from structured and unstructured data.” Data Science generally assesses hypotheses that are made on data for making business decisions. For instance, in assessing the value of houses you might notice that more bedrooms (within a certain range) may be more valuable than less bedrooms, even though the size of the house is the same. With further analyses of accounting for the extra cost to build extra bedrooms, a construction company can see what type of houses to build or a realtor will know how to value these houses, etc.\n",

Based on the input properties that we may have on them such as whether they could fly, whether they could swim, type of skin, etc. they can be classfied into certain classes. We can even define the number of classes or groups for the machine learning algorithm to cluster into. Another example could be classifying customers from a company into various groups. The groups would depend on the features of the customers that are used.\n",
